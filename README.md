# Note
Anima doesn't allow to export code on free version, so I copy and pasted the code into a Create-React-App boilerplate.

My observations:
1. Need to export image from Figma manually and place it into the proper directory. (this is because I manually copy paste code, I expect paid version does this automatically)
2. Need to label my layers in Figma properly as the output HTML will be based on it.
3. It seems hidden layers in Figma is not honoured as it'll generate the output HTML container.
4. Some middle alignment issues (see the rating stars alignment and filter button alignment)
5. Flexible layout doesn't work (probably paid version generated code fixes this)
6. Since Anima can't export various button states, looks like that will need to be coded manually.
7. Anima can do grouped components which I guess will make the code easier to read? [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocs0R5VC6Pc&feature=emb_title)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
